        <h3>A robot is a machine resembling a human being and able to replicate certain human movements and functions automatically</h3>
    </p> 
    <p class="mrinfo1">
        <h3>Therefore a medical robot is a robot used in the medical sciences. These types of robot mainly perform an assisting role and as an extra tool for the surgeon</h3>
    </p>
    <p class="mrinfo2">
        <h3>Medcial robots allow the surgeons to have an increased precision, which makes complex surgeries easier, or possible, to perform. Another advantage is that the recovery is faster as there is less blood loss, less risk of infection and less post-surgery pain.</h3>
    </p>
    <p class="mrinfo3">
        <h3>The first surgical robot was "PUMA 560" used in 1985. At the moment, the most commonly used surgical robot is the "Da Vinci" surgical system.</h3>

        <h3>3D printing is, as we all know, the action or process of maming physical objects from a three-dimensional digital model, typically by laying down many thin layers of a material in sucession.</h3>

        <h3>However, organ 3D printers are new innovative printers currently in development that consists on using bio-ink and bio materials yo create functioning organs.</h3>
